#Who

I'm Camilo Payan, a programmer and web developer at Florida International University.
I'm a sucker for endurance sports, and while I don't race, I'm not averse to trying
to increase speed either.

#Where

I'm a native Miamian, and am still based here. It's a lovely city, and it's easily
possible to push your body year round. Only downside is a lack of elevation, but hey,
you can't have it all.

#When

I'm all over the place. I'll soon be posting a calendar of events I'm planning on
attending. Hope to see you at one!

#Why

Because I get one body, and I like seeing how far I can push it, and how training
lets me push it further.

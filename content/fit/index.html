Hello, dear readers!

I'm Camilo Payan, I'm writing a blog about endurance/other-sport events that I go to, as well as any other musings about the sports I'm doing. 


So what sports do I go in for? The list is currently at:

* Running
* Bicycling
* Gymnastics
* Stand Up Paddleboarding


I want to make reviews of fitness/endurance/whatever events in the Miami or South
Florida area. I think it'd be useful to others, as well as to myself to remember the
events I liked and disliked from year to year.

The blog can also be a good platform for sharing new and interesting things I'm
trying, as well as sharing and tracking goals.

I hope I get to be a bit of a better writer with practice as well.

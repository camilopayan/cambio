# Background and Goals

[Tough Mudder](http://toughmudder.com/) is an event that needs no introduction.

# Raceday

In spite of being March in Miami, the weather was more reminiscent of Seattle than
anything I was expecting from my hometown. The sky was completely overcast. The temperature was a bracing 55 or so degrees
Fahrenheit. Since this is flat Florida, the petty spring wind that makes any
endurance sport here a trial made the air feel more like an even 50 degrees. As P and
I arrived, we knew we were in for one thing for sure: some severe weather-induced
misery.

After considering trying to get to a nearby Sports Authority and nabbing some colder
weather clothes (and being confused about whether or not we'd have to
pay twice for parking) we made our way over to the Homestead Speedway. This was
pretty much the first obstacle, as the wind pushed against us walking the whole way
and chilled my body to meat popsicle status.

We checked in to hear the MC already yelling for our wave (9:20 am, and boy did I
wish it were later) so I thanked the stars for our luck in getting in on time, and we
made our way over to the starting corral. The "obstacles" start right away with a
wall to climb just to get into the starting corral. Easy peasy.

Anyways, the start was announced and we were off for about a half a lap around the
racetrack. If you've ever watched a NASCAR race, you'll know that the curves of the
racetrack have a steep lean to them to account for the physics of driving a car that
fast in an oval, so like many people, I had fun running up and down the camber of the
track. Unfortunately, that turned out to be a huge problem for P's knees, and the
problems all stemmed from there.

Not long after we left the camber, it became apparent that running on that steep tilt had done a
number on Ps right knee (naturally). We walked stiffly over to and then right past
the Arctic Enema obstacle, because there's honestly no point to that obstacle, in my
opinion. All the while, we tried to figure out ways to get P's knee back into jogging
shape.

##Speedway Area Obstacles and Ps Knees Swan Song

The first obstacle we completed was the Leaning Walls. These are pretty normal and none-too-high
walls with the one problem of them leaning toward you so you can't really use the
wall and your knees to push yourself up and gain leverage. The obstacle was easily
taken care of, though I managed to rip my bib off in the doing. We moved on while
trying to figure out Ps knee. Stretching this way and that, trying some light jogging
to improve circulation there.

Some more walking brought us to our first mud crawl. Nothing special here either, a
short crawl in the mud with some wire to keep us low. The big surprise here was P,
who is apparently INSANELY FAST at the army crawl. The same story at every mud crawl,
he was like a rocket across those.

I finally got soaked at a grip-obstacle. It was the obstacle where you're faced with
a blank wall and some 2x4s to grip as you hang your way across. I made it all the way
across, but ended up missing my mark at the other end, slipped, and fell in the
water. Cam's first drenching, which in this cold, was pretty uncomfortable.

Considering how flat Florida is, I'm impressed that the TM team managed to throw some
hill work into the course. Using the Homestead Speedways large
bunkers of dirt on the ends, the hill work consisted of running up and down the steep
embankment again and again. Was definitely a good time, and in spite of my best
efforts, I couldn't convince anyone to roll down the rocks.

At the end of this, P and I decided that what we'd do was give up on moving P's
knee, and I'd run ahead to the next obstacle, do it, and come back to keep him
company as he limped over to the obstacle. What a trooper, I would have called it and
sat around with beer in hand miles before, and been none the worse for it.

##Spruce, Sprints, and Singing

After skipping an electric eel crawl (another one with no point to me), we came up on
the big jump into a pool. Not much to say about this one, it was just fun, and I
enjoyed it. I like how they fill all the pools with food coloring, too.

Eventually we came around to the wood carry, which was an experience. The
volunteers at the big pile of wood were having a grand time yelling and giggling
about HARD WOOD (hurr hurr hurr... I laughed pretty long and loud at those jokes).
Carrying the wood wasn't hard, what was hard was watching everyone around me who was
despondently trudging carrying their piece of wood, as though this were the worst
thing they had ever had to do. It reminded me of [the flagellants in Ingmar Bergman's
The Seventh Seal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOpvnpSsjM&t=35s), and was comparable in sheer palpable misery. After pretending my
piece of wood was a wood guitar (P's response: most guitars are wood guitars), I ran
ahead with my **hard wood**, which was surprisingly difficult. Running with the extra
weight wasn't hard, but I was carrying the wood in front of me, like a baby, and the
bouncing of the wood on my arms tired my arms out more than I realized. 

Next came more wood! This time they were Lumberjacks: uncomfortably high wood
hurdles. This was the first obstacle I did twice, actually, and is only really
notable for it. If I had to recommend a way to do it, it'd just be to jump up so your
torso is over the log, then perform the same movement as a dip to get up and over.
Worked for me. Your mileage probably won't vary much.

By this time the process of running to an obstacle, then walking again with P meant
that I always had fresh legs for my trot out to the next obstacle, which came in
useful on my way to the next obstacle. As I'm running by some people, I hear someone
yell "We've got a fast one here!" Suddenly, right behind me, I see a bit of person,
and realize someone's decided to sprint it out against me. We sprinted to the next
corner, and I won our little impromptu competition, and it's still one of my funnest
memories from the Tough Mudder. The TM may say it's a challenge and not a race, but
the spirit of competition is still a great way to get some fun out of it.

The next obstacle was fun for an entirely different reason. This was the mudder
carry, where one Mudder has to carry the other for some distance. I learned a few
things:

* The Fireman's Carry is surprisingly easy
* I can carry P
* I can carry P while pretending to sing I Will Always Love You, Whitney Houston's
  hit from The Bodyguard

He didn't appear to appreciate my vocal stylings, but I'm sure he was deeply pleased
on the inside.

##Chestnuts Roasting by an Open Fire

We made it to some mud hills: relatively small (maybe three feet high with) hills of
mud with trenches dug in between (maybe two feet deep). These weren't special so much
for their  size or difficulty, but for the sheer amount of them. Having done a few
obstacle courses, there are usually three or four of these... Tough Mudder must have
kept about ten hills there. I mucked about in the mud LIKE A FOOL. When I finished, I
saw people jumping from hill to hill, and I was insanely jealous.

The next obstacle was not necessarily my favorite, but was definitely the most
comfortable. As mentioned earlier, it was a dreary and cold day (unseasonably and
suspiciously cold for Miami in March) so when we smelled smoke, I ran ahead to rest
up and warm my body by the Tough Mudder fires. The obstacle turned out to involve
a short jump into water, though, so I made sure to complete that first, then hit the
fires again with P and warm up.

##Oh me? I'm just hanging out

The next two obstacles I remember were hanging obstacles! Finally after all this time
carrying and clambering over things, we got to jump up and hang around like our
simian-evolved hearts have been yearning for! 

First came the ring swing. I've faced this obstacle before at other obstacle courses,
and as far as I can tell, for me, it's more a test of reflexes and speed than it is
of strength. I can hold myself up on rings, I can pullmyself up on rings, but
apparently I can **not** for my life swing from ring to ring. Inevitably, I lose
momentum and end up somewhere in the middle of the ring obstacle, flailing like a
fish on a hook trying to rebuild some swing so I can get to the next ring. That's
exactly what happened at Tough Mudder, and with a heavy heart and heavier arms, I
dropped into the water. P got across, though! Fun obstacle, I'll conquer it someday.

Then came the Funky Monkey obstacle. This is more my style: safe, stable monkey bars
set up starting with a climb up an incline and
then back down to earth on a decline. This obstacle was so good to me, I managed to
do it twice, once alone and once with P and nailed it twice. Probably the proudest I
was of any one obstacle, since this time a year ago, I was still working on my very
first pullups.

##The only line, a dubiously intellectual method and a team effort

This report and my tough mudder are both coming to a close here, with only three more
obstacles really standing out in my memory. Around this point, we were walking and
came up to our first crowded obstacle: an underwater face-up crawl, where a
chain-link fence was your way of getting across. Turns out it was a brand new
obstacle called a Cage Crawl. Here's some other guy doing it:

<object width="420" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3XGhFm_5Dbs?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/3XGhFm_5Dbs?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="420" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

Around this point, we met
another friend D who had started far later than P and me, and was really pushing
himself gunning it through the course. He looked pitted, but happy with his
performance, and he quickly went past us after some pleasantries. The obstacle itself
was fun, but for some reason people were intimidated by it, making lines form. I
guess they saw it more as a long underwater swim than what it really was, a quick
fence climb that you would do on your back.

After another line at the tire pull (people apparently were dropping their tires *way
too far back*. I ended up pulling it about a lap and a half) we arrived at the last
mud crawl. Due to a lack of people there, some mudders decided this was the place to
try a dubious new technique: lying on your side (parallel to the entrance to the
obstacle) and rolling across. While they did seem to get across quickly and
painlessly, I figured that the scraps of their dignity were already strewn across the
course, and I crawled under like a normal person. P, of course, blasted through it
like he was on rails.

Finally, my last obstacle of the day (since I eschewed anything involving taser wire)
was the Everest: a halfpipe that mudders need to run up. It's a little high and steep
to run up alone, so there's always a crowd at the top of others to help. Did this
obstacle twice and had fun both times, making sure to help two people each time I
made it up. The people I had a chance to help really ran the gamut of possible
mudders.

* A normal man like me who just needed a bit of pulling
* A big hulking fellow who needed four people to help him up 
* A tiny girl who I was able to practically pick up and put on the platform
* A very athletic man who wasn't expecting help and kind of barrelled into my arms.
  Most awkward hug.

All in all, a good time. I'm realizing I forgot the famous Berlin Walls that are too
high to climb without help, but I climbed them anyway. No biggie.

##Conclusion

That's the Tough Mudder. I'd do it again, though I'm not sure I'd want to do it in
Miami again. I probably will anyways. I know P is motivated to retry.

# Administrative

No real complaints here. Registration was easy, and P and I registered far ahead of
time. We got reminder emails (not even too many, like most runs will do) and checking
in was painless.

# Route

Only one word can describe the route we took: **boring**. I knew this ahead of time:
the venue in the end, is actually a parking lot. It's flat and desolate, without
vegetation besides scratchy grass or scenery besides the speedway. There's nothing
else to say about this.

# Raceday organization

The raceday organization was tight work! We apparently arrived late (though earlier
than our wave start, I think they were just trying to get people into the corral
quicker) but went through checkin easily enough. We didn't have any problems, though
there were three mysterious wrist bands, none of which were ever clearly used for
anything. 

All the obstacles were well-staffed and clean, nothing seemed rickety or dangerous to
be on. Postrun was likewise quick and clean: you got your schwag, your beer, and
moved on easily. The main complaint would be getting to and from the actual speedway
involved a pretty boring trudge from the parking area. Also, it was into the cold
wind on the way to the start, but now I'm just whining.

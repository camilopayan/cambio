# Background and Goals

The Snowbird Century is an annual spring century here in Miami, put on by the
[Everglades Bicycle Club](http://evergladesbc.com). The Everglades Bicycle Club is (I
think) the club in Miami with the longest-running history, helping people have a
group to ride with since 1976.

Every year, they put on a series of rides in the snowbird century, ranging in
distance: 20 miles, 40 miles, metric century (100km), and imperial century (100 miles). My plan here was
to go down with my father and ride the metric century. The ride, like most long rides
in Miami Dade County, was set in the farmlands of Homestead.

My goal here was to complete the metric century and have a good time. Originally, I
meant to complete the imperial century, but sickness forced me to miss a week off
some already pretty-bad training, and I decided to opt for fun over suffering.

# Raceday

In most places, the huge obstacle to road riding is climbing. Riding up a mountain
and then back down its slopes is a quintessential part of riding a bicycle on the
road. The queen stages of grand tours are always mountain stages, and the most famous American
century rides all boast their elevation changes. Obviously, this isn't an option in
Miami, and the great spring obstacle for Miami riders isn't climbing but wind. 

The wind was strong from the outset of the Snowbird Century, and it was immediately
obvious that without a group to split the time in the wind. The morning weather
report showed recorded winds of 13-15mph from the south, and that the winds were
going to grow stronger over time. The race started without much ado, and the police
escorted us across US-1 into the farmlands.

The ride was immediately problematic. Teams were getting themselves organized into
solid double pacelines, but going slowly, and regardless I'm too cheap for team dues,
so I quickly went past them. The front, however, was a mess of riders who couldn't
keep lines or paces at all. Riders kept moving in and out of line with the rider in
front of them and yo-yoing off their wheels. The atmosphere up there became more and
more tense. The last straw for me was listening to one rider talking his less
experienced friend through riding in a group. Please do **some** group rides before
tackling a century, folks. I went off the front just to get some peace of mind back.

After a while, a group joined me and we all had a grand time riding like normal human
beings. Of course, not long after that, I was totally gassed from all the efforts
(and probably the lack of training), and ended up falling off the back, where a group
with my father caught me. I stuck with them for a long while, until a pretty unclear
turning made me drop even further back. Our group got broken apart, since we didn't
know whether only 100 mile riders were supposed to turn there or both 100 mile riders
and 100km riders. It was very confusing and I found myself chasing the very group of
dicey riders I was trying to avoid.

The wind brought most of the groups back together, and I found myself moving up
little by little in the group, taking shelter for rests and then moving up the side.
Again, though, gaps, cursing, and swerving were common, and it was really no fun to
be in the group. Eventually I found my dad again and we went down Aerojet Road to the
turnaround of the ride.

Aerojet Road is a few miles long, and totally north-south. This north-south
orientation made the ride south on Aerojet Road entirely merciless, pitting riders
against still strengthening winds for miles. On the *other* hand, on the way back,
Aerojet grants a near-perfect tailwind and what was easily the most fun part of the
ride. Here's where I hit the max speed of the ride, which by my watch was 34 mph, and
had an absolute blast doing it.

Everything has to come to and end though, and by the time we needed to turn east, the
winds were blowing much harder than they had earlier in the ride. Crosswinds felt like they
would blow the bike out from under you, and headwinds had me putting out enormous
effort just to inch along at 12mph. It was brutal, and I ended up dropping off the
back of the group I was with and riding alone into the headwind.

The ride meandered along for a while, eventually crossing US-1 again and turning to
go around the Homestead Speedway. After that, it was a short stretch back to the
Homestead Air Force Reserve Park and some beer and food. 

It was a good ride, and I
didn't feel awful at any point in the ride, but I definitely need more miles in my
legs. At the moment, I'm kind of goalless, though, so I'm still looking for something
else to train for.

# Administrative

This is obviously a group that knows what they're doing. The cost wasn't too high for
the race, and everything was simple to take care of. My father was able to get my
packet without a problem, too, which kept me from having to worry about it the
morning of the race. Ugly t-shirt, though.

# Route

Fun and familiar for me. Miami weekend rides usually come here at least once on the
weekend.

# Raceday organization

Totally organized, though I wish there were some better way to mark the route. I
should also probably get a holder for my handlebars so I can keep the map/turns in
front of me.

# Background and Goals

The Foam Fest is a YATOC (Yet Another Traveling Obstacle Course), and a themed one, at that. Unlike Superhero Scramble and some others which just aim to put stuff in your way, the Foam Fest isn't timed and has a theme of soapy obstacles.

There wasn't too much point to this run. Just a fun time after the Miami Half Marathon the week before. Unfortunately, G was injured, so our goal for the Foam Fest was just to keep from slipping and hurting ourselves. We went with some other friends and resolved to have a grand old time.

# Raceday

The venue was Amelia Earhart Park in Hialeah. This has to be one of the better big parks in Miami Dade County, and it makes for a good raceday. Foam Fest had a pavilion set up to greet runners, with food trucks and the regular check-in and gear check amenities. It didn't seem to be very well attended, but that could do with competition with Color Me Rad, which is a YATOC around Sun Life Stadium, this time where you throw paint at each other.

The race was interesting, and I did a fair amount of running before settling in with G and some slower friends. The trails were hard on the other participants, but I'm pretty used to the ones at Amelia. Thanks to some shark hats we had decided to wear, I definitely got the benefit of the doubt when passing people and being brusque, so that helped.

The obstacles were a high point, including some of my favorite toys from childhood: Bounce Houses! Bounce houses are pretty much air-filled happiness structures, reminding you that all your problems can be bounced away. Some of the advertised obstacles weren't there (like the 50 foot slip n slide), but one of the big obstacles, the Death Drop (a huge inflatable water slide), was well worth the wait.

# Administrative

By far the **worst** part of this race was the administrative aspect. Of course, they used Active, and that's always going to introduce some issues. In this case, everything went fairly smoothly, but then, in spite of signing five waivers and spending nearly 70 dollars on registration alone, I was sent an email asking to pay five dollars more for insurance. Again, waivers releasing liability for pretty much everything short of thermonuclear war still required five more dollars for insurance, a cost that should have been built into registration. After sorting that out, everything should have been fine, but then I received another email asking for insurance. Not only was the mistake made in the first place, but then it was repeated.

Another problem was parking. The park used for this charges 6 dollars for parking, however Foam Fest insisted on charging 10 dollars for parking. When we arrived at the park, the park staff directed us away from the regular park and over to the foam fest parking, where we were being charged extra.

**All of this gave the sense of a mismanaged race whose purpose was to overcharge, underdeliver, and then nickel and dime its customers. I wouldn't do this race again, and wouldn't recommend it.**

# Route

The park is beautiful. The route was boring, but there's no real way to fit obstacles in Amelia without some flatness. There seemed like there should have been more water portions, but oh well.

# Raceday organization

I was expecting the worst, but the organization on raceday was just fine.

# Background and Goals

I've written about them before, but let's just admit there are a lot of Down2Earth events. I happen to have a "VIP" pass for the year, so a lot of their events are going to show up on this record. Down2Earth has a year-long series of trail runs, which are on local Miami mountain bike trails at Amelia Earhart Park in Hialeah and Oleta River State Park in North Miami.

This report is for the Amelia Earhart Park trail run series. Since I'm currently training for the Snowbird Century bike ride, I'm not really in a shape to have a goal for this 10k. I figured having some fun and trying to stay in contention for the top 3 spots (they're not particularly competitive runs) should be enough to have a good time. I've won the 10k in the past with respectable times all hovering around the one hour mark.

# Raceday

G and I arrived there bright and early at about 7:20am, sleepy and tired, with a breakfast of some plain white rice with an egg on top as our only fuel so far that day. G was there for the 5k, I was there for the 10k. After registering and all that, we got ready for the race, and had our first mishap!

Apparently there were enough people for a wave start instead of a bunch start, but I was busy putting some things (phone, vip passes) into the car. I got back in time for me to see G telling me that it was time to go, so I went with the first group... which were the people racing the half marathon. Apparently they asked for 10k-ers to come back, but I was already down the line and couldn't hear. Oh well, I ran the rest of the race.

The people around me were all half marathoners, which I'm always surprised to find are very fast on the trails. Two guys ahead of me, and a pair behind me of triathletes, it was an interesting time. 

I was running alone however, and was fairly unpleasantly surprised. My legs felt dead from the get-go, and weren't waking up. I don't know if it's the cycling workouts or my nutrition, but it's probably both. It had been about three months since I had done any running on the trails, and it showed. The lumps on the trails were all torture, and the rocks on the road felt like knives in my feet. I turned my ankles a few times (no injuries, though), and rammed both my feet into roots. All in all, I was running on the trail as if I were running on smooth flat sidewalk (which I had been exclusively since December) and it felt wretched.

The race is structured so that one follows little signs along the trails in a loop to the start/finish line. One loop is 5k, so 10k-ers had to do two loops (half marathoners do 4). The first loop was a fairly trying experience, but the second loop went much better. While not actually waking up, my legs at least felt stretched out by then, and I had a smoother time on the rocks and little climbs.

By the time the finish came around, I was ready to be done. Lo and behold, I was the first 10k-er back! I didn't hit the sub 1hr goal that's going to hang over every 10k trail run this year, but I did manage to win the race. But wait! If you recall, I started a bit early, so I decided to wait around a bit with G (who had finished her first trail 5k! round of applause).

Second and third place came in, and luckily, all of us were wearing GPS watches. After explaining what happened, we all put our superfluous training devices together and came up with the real ordering for the race... which was exactly the same as the original ordering! I took my gold and decided to be pleased with the day. G got a gold medal for the 5k as well!

All in all, a good race. I can't wait to spend some time training on the trails to hit the real goal of a sub-1hr trail 10k.

# Route

The Amelia Earhart mountain bike trails are pretty well kept, and challenging to run on. Kind of rocky. Like most of Miami, it's fairly flat, and all the climbing is not-natural, but that's fine. The routes always weave in and out of existing MTB trails, sometimes going backwards on the trail. Backwards trails are probably the most demanding, since instead of having the gentler grade for a bike going up, you have the much steeper grade for a bike going downhill.

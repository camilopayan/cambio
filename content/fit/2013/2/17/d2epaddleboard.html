# Background and Goals

**La Roootaaa Regattaaa** is a series of standup paddleboard races put on by a local Miami company called [Down 2 Earth](http://www.worksmartplayharder.com). This race is also presented by [Jimmy Lewis](http://www.jimmylewis.com/) who makes boards, I guess. You start at the [Blue Marlin Fish House](https://plus.google.com/101317513413788814323/about?gl=us&hl=en). All of this is pretty boring, but I figured that gives enough background.

I didn't have any real goal for this. Just to go out, have, fun, and see how quickly I could go 4.2 miles in a go. I've only been paddleboarding once before... it was fun, so I decided to race boards, too.

# Raceday

Definitely got there way too early. I was under the impression that the race started at 7:30am, but it turns out that it actually started at 9am. Oh well, waiting definitely eases anticipation, right? Nope.

An hour of impatience later, I rented out a paddleboard for the race. This was a racing board, which apparently are less flat on the bottom, thus less inherently stable. The rental guy assured me that the rails (whatever those are) would catch me if I leaned too far one way or the other. With a board in hand, it was time to hit the water.

Getting into the water was fun, but staying above water during the race was an experience. The board was definitely unstable, but the rental guy was right. Whenever I leaned too far to one side, the board seemed to catch a bit and stabilize. Awesome, ready to race.

The race start was cool. I started from the back since I knew I wouldn't be in contention. Upside: wasn't in anyone's way. Downside: Water churn! It's hard to stay balanced on an already unstable board when the water's being churned into a mess by the thirty odd people in front of you. Managed it anyway, and was off down the Oleta River.

All the bends on the river were fun, and a good way for me to practice trying to pick and hold a line on the board. The scenery was pretty great, too. I'll describe it more in the Route section.

After getting some tips from other members of the race caboose, things went along a little better, and I eventually made it to the Intracostal Waterway, where we turned left. This was definitely an easier stretch to paddleboard. The waterway itself was empty, but the lack of bends here made for straightforward paddleboarding. While I was going along, I definitely could imagine that if I were a competent paddleboarder, I'd be sprinting on this straightaway.

Down through a canal to a small lake, where the wind refused to cooperate. Struggling against the wind and current to hold a straight line to the diagonally opposite end of the lake, I found myself reassured by one of the race kayak guys (who were dispersed along the route to make sure no one left) that there was, in fact, no current or wind. He told me about races wher ethe winds were knocking people off their boards, and I had to agree that I was indeed being a pansy.

After the lake a small stretch and then the finish! Where I found that the whole ordeal took 1h05m in total.

# Administrative

Down2Earth is a tight organization. No administrative problems at all.

# Route

The route was great. The route takes you on the Oleta River, through to the Intracoastal Waterway, then down a residential canal into Maule Lake. Finally, underneath Sunny Isles Boulevard back to Blue Marlin Fish House.

## The Oleta River

Everything you'd want. Bendy in a nonthreatening way, calm, and the scenery was great. The banks are covered in mangroves, and if you don't see a bunch of native Florida birds around, you just aren't looking. I think they're herons and ibises and so on, but I'm no ornithologist.

Definitely a nice paddle through here.

## Intracoastal Waterway

We had been warned before the race to watch for boaters, but that due to the weather of the day (cold by Miami standards, gray and windy) there probably wouldn't be many. The water's calm doesn't look like it would be disturbed by much besides a boat's
wake.

No bends, this is a straight shot down the waterway, between some apartments as well. One man even shouted "good job" from his balcony, though I wouldn't say the race had much of an audience.

## Maule Lake

This lake is the spiritual opposing force of the river and the waterway. Where those gave you direction, and few options, the lake just plops you into what starts out as an intimidatingly large body of water, with too many options. Should you go with the current and go off course? Should you soldier on in a straight line? Was a fun ride.

Also, if you like boats, there's a marina in the lake, so you can definitely decide to dawdle and ogle ships.

# Raceday organization

Organized. I got there too early this time, though. Next time, breakfast and sleep are going to be the orders of the day.

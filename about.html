a user account on his home Linux box and told me that I could put whatever I 
wanted on my home folder&#39;s public_html folder. Those were the days, when CSS
needed to prove the need for its existence and Javascript was buggy and table 
layouts ruled the roost. <em><strong>Good Riddance to all that.</strong></em></p>
<p>Since then, I&#39;ve gotten a degree in computer science from Florida International
University and fallen in love with the sheer vastness of what can be 
accomplished on the web. Every day, there&#39;s something new to learn about and 
while it can seem like a person can&#39;t keep up with everything, it&#39;s never boring
and I&#39;ve made it a point to keep learning.</p>
<p>That&#39;s meant dabbling in a plenty of places, playing with languages from Python
and Ruby to OCaml. That&#39;s meant getting as deep as possible into the stalwart 
languages that form the foundation of the web: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP.
That&#39;s meant learning tools and skills outside development, like sysadmin work 
with Apache, setting up devops tools, learning UX practices, and trying to 
figure out business processes.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently working at Florida International University as a web developer
and content management system administrator. The team I&#39;m on there, <a href="https://webcomm.fiu.edu">Digital 
Communications</a> has been responsible for moving FIU&#39;s
web presence forward. We have, in a big way. Before the team existed, FIU&#39;s 
homepage was basically just a directory of links. Afterwards, it became a real 
content site. You know, with words and explanations. After I joined, we pushed 
toward a responsive design method, that&#39;s become a standard for all webmasters
at the University.</p></div></body></html>
